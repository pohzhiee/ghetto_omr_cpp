# Ghetto OMR
Planned to be done using opencv and Gtk, using opencv c++ and Gtkmm bindings


Things to be done:
1) Complete GUI (WIP, hard due to many custom widgets to be done)
2) Port opencv python code to c++ (TBD after 1 is done)
3) Framework for storing data into file, such that data is centralised (TBD)
4) CSS styling (TBD)
